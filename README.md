Application for managing data about fuel cell suppliers and their products.

For some time I was trying to find a good and interesting subject for my personal "portfolio" project. Since I am currently working with fuel cells, and quite a lot of my work resolves around gathering data from various manufacturers about their products and their companies, I decided to write an application that will allow for storing this data in more convenient and organised form than Excel files.

I will try to update this as often as possible but due to the fact that I am still learning (and working) things may go in its own pace, especially that I will try to focus on good practices (we will see how will I do on that).

To give you a general idea of what this app should do once it is done:
1. Store a supplier company data like: company name, number of employees, year of foundation, status of the NDA file as well as the possibility to store the file itself, etc.
2. Store a data about key contacts from the given supplier: their names, positions, emails, phone numbers, remarks, etc.
3. Store a history of communications between "us" and the company in form of reports (would be nice to be able to write them in app using markdown text).
4. Store a companys roadmap (in our case, we like to know what the supplier is up to for a couple of years ahead, a nice way to store and edit this data could be valuable in real life setting).
5. Finally store a data about the actual products (fuel cells, maybe some related ones as well).
6. I will be happy if I will manage to create a auto-generated comparisons between these (chosen) products as well.
